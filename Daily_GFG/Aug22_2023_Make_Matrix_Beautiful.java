Problem Statement: A beautiful matrix is a matrix in which the sum of elements in each row and column is equal. Given a square matrix of size NxN. Find the minimum number of operation(s) that are required to make the matrix beautiful. In one operation you can increment the value of any one cell by 1

Solution Approach: Get the sum of all rows and all columns in rowsum and colsum arrays.
Get the maxsum value in both of them, get the total operations by getting the difference for all the
rowsum's from the max value sum of the array.

Imp: If you can make all rows have the same sum, then all columns will automatically have the same sum, and vice versa. 
This is due to the conservation of elements in the matrix.
This is because you are only redistributing the elements among the rows, not changing their values.
